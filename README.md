Solved part 1 

I knew this required parametric equations (though I didn't know that's what they were called at the time), so I watched a non-trivial amount of the Khan academy series on linear algebra before looking really attempting this. I got really hung up on the fact that you need to divide the ∆position vector by the ∆velocity vector, since vector division is not a straightforward thing. I eventually gave in and looked at others' answers and learned that you have to multiple by the inverse of the ∆velocity vector, which also requires rearranging the operation such that it becomes a square matrix. I *still* don't pretend to understand matrix inversion, though I get that not all matrices are invertible. I was starting to get fatigued by this point, so I didn't bother with part two.
